Texty is a small, simple text adventure engine written in Java. 

It mostly exists as an exercise for me to practice my Java - it's been a while
since I wrote some!

State initialisation is still rather clunky, but I'm hoping to fix this if
I ever look at this code again. :)

To-do: To ease initialisation, devise a small mark-up language and parse it. Or maybe use XML or JSON or similar.
