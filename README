Texty is a small, simple text adventure engine written in Java. 

It mostly exists as an exercise for me to practice my Java - it's been a while
since I wrote some!

State initialisation is still rather clunky, but I'm hoping to fix this if
I ever look at this code again. :)

To ease initialisation, devise a small mark-up language and parse it. Or maybe use XML or JSON or similar.

To-do:
- Add option to enable hints
- Add textyOutput for both narration and dialogue, and textyInput for input - done
    - Possibly abstract out IO so that there could be textyCLIO and textyGUIIO - done
- Design parser
- Design mark-up language
    - Design grammar
    - coco/r or parsing manually?
